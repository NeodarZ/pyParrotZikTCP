2. Install Parrot Tray Zik
http://goo.gl/dXij2t (outdated version supporting only Zik 1.0)
3. Run ParrotZikTray.exe

## Linux Usage

1. Connect Parrot Zik with standard bluetooth connection
2. Install the applet
   ```
   python setup install
   ```
3. Run the applet
   ```
   parrot_zik_tray
   ```

### Linux Requirement

Python-bluez is needed. On ubuntu based distro run

```
sudo apt-get install python-bluez python-appindicator python-beautifulsoup
```

## Mac OS Usage

Current version of pyParrotZik doesn't support Mac OS(even the core should work on Mac OS). Looking for volunteer to do all the dirty work(mostly GUI).

You can also use excellent Parrot-Status tool developed specially for Mac OS (https://github.com/vincent-le-normand/Parrot-Status)
